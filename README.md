# Terror-Attack-Info

Android app which will display events of terror attacks all over the world. Main activity consists of two tabs, one is a Map tab (Google Maps v2) where icons with brief summaries are displayed, and Info tab which includes full descriptions, locations and other info. You will be able to choose what types of events are shown and how old they are.
